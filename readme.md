# Array Equals
Javascript doesn't have built-in shallow equality checking. So I wrote a library for it!

**Please don't actually use this. It's a joke.**

## How to use!
### Browser
1. Use `<script type="module">`
2. Import `import arrayEquals from 'https://unpkg.com/array-equals';`
3. Call it! `let bool = arrayEquals(a1, a2);`
   
### Node
